# C++ GamePhysicsEngine

A robust and efficient C++ physics engine for 2D/3D simulations, featuring collision detection, rigid body dynamics, and soft-body physics. Designed for easy integration into game engines and simulation projects.

## Author

**David Iwezulu**

## Features

- **Rigid Body Dynamics**: Simulate solid objects with mass, velocity, and acceleration.
- **Soft Body Physics**: Simulate deformable objects like cloth and jelly.
- **Collision Detection**: Detect and resolve collisions between objects.
- **Extensible Design**: Easily extend functionalities or integrate into existing projects.
- **Cross-Platform**: Compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- C++17 or later
- CMake 3.10 or later
- A compatible C++ compiler (GCC, Clang, MSVC)

### Building the Engine

```bash
git clone https://github.com/davidiwezulu/GamePhysicsEngine.git
cd GamePhysicsEngine
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```
### Running Examples
``` 
./examples/RigidBodyDemo
./examples/SoftBodyDemo
```
### Usage
Include the engine in your project:
``` 
#include "PhysicsEngine.h"

// Create a physics engine instance
PhysicsEngine physicsEngine;

// Add physics bodies
RigidBody* rigidBody = new RigidBody();
physicsEngine.addRigidBody(rigidBody);

// Run the simulation
double deltaTime = 0.016; // 60 FPS
physicsEngine.update(deltaTime);
```
### Documentation
Detailed documentation is available in the docs/ directory or can be generated using Doxygen.
