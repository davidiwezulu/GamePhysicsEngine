## Introduction

The **GamePhysicsEngine** is a 2D/3D physics engine that provides support for rigid body dynamics, soft-body physics, and collision detection. The engine is designed to be lightweight and easily integrable into game engines or simulation environments.

## Installation

To build and install the engine, follow these steps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/davidiwezulu/GamePhysicsEngine.git
cd GamePhysicsEngine
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```
### Using the Engine
To use the engine, you need to create a physics engine instance and add physical bodies to the simulation.

```
#include "PhysicsEngine.h"

PhysicsEngine engine;

RigidBody* body = new RigidBody();
engine.addRigidBody(body);

engine.update(deltaTime);
```
# API Reference

## PhysicsEngine

- `addRigidBody(RigidBody* rigidBody)`: Adds a rigid body to the physics simulation.
- `addSoftBody(SoftBody* softBody)`: Adds a soft body to the physics simulation.
- `update(double deltaTime)`: Updates the physics engine state by a time step.

## RigidBody

- `setMass(double mass)`: Sets the mass of the rigid body.
- `applyForce(const Vector3& force)`: Applies a force to the rigid body.
- `integrate(double deltaTime)`: Integrates the motion of the rigid body over time.

## SoftBody

- `addNode(const Vector3& position)`: Adds a node to the soft body.
- `addLink(int nodeA, int nodeB)`: Adds a link (spring) between two nodes.
- `integrate(double deltaTime)`: Integrates the motion of the soft body over time.

# Examples

For examples on how to use the engine, see the `examples/` directory.

- `RigidBodyDemo.cpp`: Demonstrates rigid body dynamics.
- `SoftBodyDemo.cpp`: Demonstrates soft body physics.
